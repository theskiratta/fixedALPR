# FixedALPR
A fully configurable resource for FiveM that places functional plate readers and speed cameras around the map.

## Configuration Options:
- Model to be used as camera
- Individual speed limit, detection range, name and coordinates for each location
- Code can be easily modified to add custom event trigger or similar, i.e. to trigger an alert to the police or send someone an invoice if they were speeding

## Performance:
Resource sits at 0.01ms when ambient and gets up to 0.05ms when in a vehicle.

## Credits:
- Rockstar Games: 3D Model for camera (with edits by me)
- Me (theskiratta): Code
